      "1": "MayeHisCaffBeFine (mattyoungin) absolutely put the league on notice, racking up 135.88 points thanks to a monster day from Christian McCaffrey (31.4) and Justin Jefferson (22.0), plus Tua Tagovailoaâ€™s efficient 17.2â€”while BurrowBoiSeason (BigBoiSeason) self-sabotaged by benching Amon-Ra St. Brown (26.1) and fading Travis Kelce in the TE spot (14.0). To add insult, James Conner limped off early with a shoulder tweakâ€”rookie mistake. Smack talk: Better dust off your waiver strategy next week, BurrowBoi. ðŸ¥´",
      "2": "Koo my Warren till I Kupp (adamloo) lit up the scoreboard with Patrick Mahomesâ€™ 29.6 and Tyreek Hillâ€™s 18.5, steamrolling Nacua Matata (mmalsin) 124.62â€“99.06. Nacua Matataâ€™s flex gamble on Drake London (11.2) over JuJu Smith-Schuster (15.0) was straight-up tragic, and Aaron Jonesâ€™ last-second ankle scratch sealed the deal. Smack talk: Hope you packed the tissues, mmalsin, because that defeat stings.",
      "3": "Ready 4 Cancun (michaelb555) cruised to a 109.38â€“93.86 victory over MasterBater (mattcinelli) behind Amon-Ra St. Brownâ€™s 26.1 and solid support from Joe Mixon (18.5). MasterBaterâ€™s faith in Deâ€™Von Achane (6.5) flopped, and benching Rondale Moore (12.4) felt like amateur hour. Smack talk: MasterBater, pick better next timeâ€”or just sit this league out.",
      "4": "Champ (BrendanKane) outgunned In CEST zone (ItalianGardettos) 107.58â€“88.12, thanks to Patrick Mahomesâ€™ dual-threat day (29.6) and Travis Kelceâ€™s vintage 14.0. ItalianGardettosâ€™ punt on Kyren Williams (4.8) was the rookie blunder heard â€™round the league, and Christian Kirkâ€™s ankle tweak left a gaping hole. Smack talk: ItalianGardettosâ€”sit down, son. This was a masterclass, not a moral victory.",
      "5": "Kamara Sutra (BiggoJohnson) throttled Droppinâ€™ a Deuce (moneymike805) 131.52â€“102.78, fueled by Bijan Robinsonâ€™s 22.7 and a surprise from Jaylen Waddle (16.3). Droppinâ€™ a Deuceâ€™s DJ Moore ghosted them with just 7.3 points, and Aaron Jonesâ€™ lingering ankle issue cost a critical flex spot. Smack talk: Better dust off that Snapchat filter, moneymike805â€”you got roasted.",
      "6": "Chasing Wittle Kyler (milesbarrios) outlasted Gibb me dat (nforbes6) 110.42â€“86.34 as Tua Tagovailoa (17.2) and Brock Purdy (20.2) outduelled Josh Jacobs (12.9) and Nico Collins (14.4). Gibb me datâ€™s benching of Courtland Sutton (11.0) over Elijah Moore (8.2) was criminalâ€”rookie mistake alert. Smack talk: Gibb me dat, hope your dignity is still intact after that curb stomp."
