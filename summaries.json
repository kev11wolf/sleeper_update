        "summary": "In a battle of the ages, **MayeHisCaffBeFine** overcame **BurrowBoiSeason** with a score of 135.88 to 83.92. BigBoiSeason might be regretting his decision to start a second-string running back. With Aaron Rodgers throwing picks and the Packers defense slipping, they simply couldn't compete! Maybe next week, BurrowBoi?"

        "summary": "**Koo my Warren till I Kupp** stormed past **Nacua Matata** with an impressive 124.62 score, showcasing McCaffrey's dazzling moves and Kupp’s route-running wizardry. On the flip side, Nacua Matata was derailed by critical injuries; losing a starting wide receiver early! Ouch! Watch out for Koo next week!"

      "3": {
        "summary": "**Ready 4 Cancun** flexed their muscles over **MasterBater** with a dominant 99.28 points versus 77.86. With an all-star lineup, Cancun's squad picked apart a defense that seemed to forget this was a competitive match. MasterBater—better luck somewhere else next week!”
      },
      "4": {
        "summary": "**Champ** snagged victory through grit against **In CEST zone**, scoring 107.58 to 88.12. The performance by Mahomes was electric, while ItalianGardettos thought starting a defense against the Chiefs was a smart move. Spoiler: It wasn't! Expect Champ to ride this momentum into next week."
      },
      "5": {
        "summary": "**Kamara Sutra** proved to be the team to beat, crushing **Droppin' a Deuce** 131.52 to 96.78. BiggoJohnson’s squad had all the right picks, while a questionable bench decision cost Deuce the game. Keep an eye on Kamara—it looks like he’s back to his dominant self!"
      },
      "6": {
        "summary": "**Chasing Wittle Kyler** took down **Gibb me dat** 96.22 to 86.34, but it was a hard-fought battle! Injury woes plagued Gibb throughout the match, leading to subpar performances. Kyler’s late-game heroics snatched the win, but they need to tighten up their roster if they expect to compete!”
