provide a plain text update for week XXX of the nfl season. i want a 3 sentence high level summary of key games, key plays, interesting news outside the field, noteable injuries, and whatever else you can find. make it sounds like a sports reporter wrote it who has a very dry sense of humor as well slightly vulgar and rude/sassy. extra points for any interesting facts not related to football or drama that happened off the field. make it sounds like a news reporter is talking during a broadcast, and keep it simple. no need for super excessive fancy words. just ruthless, unfiltered, unhinged, and mean humor.
